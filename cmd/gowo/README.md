# gowo - CLI for owo

This is an example of how to use the library and also serves as a neat CLI.
You can find built binaries [here](https://github.com/whats-this/owo.go/releases).
To use the binaries you need owo key in a config file.
By default it looks for a config file named `.gowo.yaml` (other formats also applicable, but not tested) in `$HOME` & `./` (current working directory)
Currently gowo only cares about `key` and `cdn`, respectively `key` is the api key provided to you by service admins and `cdn` is the domain your uploaded files will be prefixed with.
